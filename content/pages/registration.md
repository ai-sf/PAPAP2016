Such fee will cover the cost of accommodation in both L'Aquila and Rome, breakfast at the Federico II Hotel, 2 lunches at the LNGS, IAPS clothing, a day-trip to the Campo Imperatore resort, travel from Rome to L’Aquila (and viceversa), as well as travel from the Federico II Hotel to the Gran Sasso (and viceversa) during the days of our visits.

<li><p>Insurance;</p></li>
<li><p>Public transport from Frascati to the centre of Rome and in Rome;</p></li>
	      <li><p>Meals other than those officially offered in the Programme. In particular, participants will need to pay for all their dinners, their breakfast in Rome, lunch at the ENEA Frascati centre and any extra expenses that they might wish to make. The Organising Committee will always suggest places to eat, according to students' needs. </p></li>
