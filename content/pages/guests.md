	<p>Giancarlo Cella is a physicist, researcher at the INFN
sez. Pisa. He started his career working on perturbative QCD and
lattice gauge theory. He is currently involved in the VIRGO
collaboration, an experiment aiming to the direct observation of
gravitational waves. He is interested mainly in phenomenology and
detection of stochastic background of gravitational waves,
gravitational wave data analysis and advanced detectors.</p>

the Italian National Institute for Metrological Research (INRIM). He
is Fellow of the Accademia dei Lincei, the American Physical Society
and the European Optical Society.  For the European Research Council
(ERC) he was Chairman (2007-2010) and Member (2012 and 2014) of the
Scientific Panel PE2 “Fundamental Constituents of Matter”. He received
prizes, such as the Humboldt Research Award by the Humboldt Foundation
(2004), the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences (2005) and
the “Herbert Walther” Award (2014) of the Deutsche Physikalische

	<p>Andrea Macchi received a M.Sc. degree (Laurea) in Physics
	  from the University of Pisa in 1995 with honors (110/110 cum laude)
	  and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore of
	  Pisa in 1999 with honors (70/70 cum laude).</p>
	<p>Andrea Macchi has been active in laser-matter interaction at very
high intensities, beginning as an experimentalist (mostly working on
	  X-ray emission from laser-produced plasmas) and later focusing on
	  theory and simulation, still in close contact with experimental
	  work. He has given contributions on topics such as collisionless
	  absorption, surface wave excitation, ion acceleration, nonlinear
	  coherent structures. </p>
	<p>A.M. is a staff research scientist with CNR/INO since
	  2010. Previously he was with CNR/INFM (2003-2009). He held a
	  postdoctoral position at the Darmstadt University of Technology
	  (1998-2000) and an International Fellowship at the Queen's University
	  of Belfast (2008). He participated to many collaborative European and
	  Italian projects, also as principal investigator or local coordinator
	  since 2005.</p>
	<p> A.M. is the author or coauthor of about 70 publications on
	  peer reviewed journals (with a H-index of 24 to date) including a
	  Review of Modern Physics and 11 Physical Review Letters, the single
	  author of a textbook on Laser-Plasma Interactions (Springer, 2013) and
	  the first author of a textbook with 100 problems of Classical
	  Electromagnetism (in Italian). He presented tens of seminars and talks
	  (both invited and contributed) to international conferences and
	  schools. He has been serving as a referee for about 30 international
	  journals (with recognition as outstanding referee for the American
	  Physical Society in 2015) and for 6 funding and evaluation agencies of
	  different countries.</p>
	<p>A.M. collaborates since 2002 to teaching activities at the
	  Physics Department of the University of Pisa for the undergraduate
	  (B.Sc.), postgraduate (M.Sc.) and doctorate (Ph.D.)  programs. He
	  gives lecture courses of Plasma Physics since 2009 and is Lecturer of
	  Classical Electrodynamics since 2012. He has been the supervisor of 2
	  Ph.D., 11 postgraduate (M.Sc.) and 17 undergraduate (B.Sc.) students
	  to date, with 3 more Ph.D. (co-)supervisions running.</p>

	<p>Jose M. González Castro is currently doing his PhD within the VIRGO group at Pisa trying to find
	  unexpected sources of stray light for the gravitational wave detector
	  located in Cascina.
	  He got My Msc in Physics at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, where his
	  thesis topic was on Numerical Methods for hemodialysis. After he got his
	  master degree, he started working into the world of optical design for
	  cinematographic lenses in a small company based in Barcelona area until he
	  moved to Pisa to start his PhD.
