* During the event, we will visit the ENEA laboratories in Frascati, where we will visit the Laser ABC experiment, which explores the conditions required for inertial confinement fusion and other extreme states of matter. We hope to be able to visit the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade magnetic confinement fusion facility as well, just a few steps away.
-->

* The Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) hosts many of the most advanced astroparticle physics experiments in the world, having made scientific journals' front pages on several occasions. The facilities can be accessed via the Gran Sasso tunnel and are buried below 1400 meters of solid rock, within the Gran Sasso mountain.


* The Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI) is a modern institution focusing on astroparticle physics, mathematics and modelling. Its location close to the LNGS offers its members a unique opportunity to access world-class experiments within the mountain. The GSSI has an active PhD programme in Physics and will be displaying some of the work that students do there.

* During this year’s event, we also hope to be able to visit the INFN laboratories in Frascati, near Rome; however, the participation of INFN in our programme is <b>not yet confirmed</b> and hence will not be described in detail on this webpage. Future updates on the subject will be provided when possible.

* During our visits, we will be offered a large number of talks, as in the 2015 edition. In particular, we expect to have overviews of all the major experiments running at the LNGS. The experience can be overwhelming! We will provide further details of our speakers as they become available.<!-- </p> -->

<!-- 	<p>Andrea Macchi received a M.Sc. degree (Laurea) in Physics -->
<!-- 	  from the University of Pisa in 1995 with honors (110/110 cum laude) -->
<!-- 	  and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore of -->
<!-- 	  Pisa in 1999 with honors (70/70 cum laude).</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>Andrea Macchi has been active in laser-matter interaction at very -->
<!-- high intensities, beginning as an experimentalist (mostly working on -->
<!-- 	  X-ray emission from laser-produced plasmas) and later focusing on -->
<!-- 	  theory and simulation, still in close contact with experimental -->
<!-- 	  work. He has given contributions on topics such as collisionless -->
<!-- 	  absorption, surface wave excitation, ion acceleration, nonlinear -->
<!-- 	  coherent structures. </p> -->
<!-- 	<p>A.M. is a staff research scientist with CNR/INO since -->
<!-- 	  2010. Previously he was with CNR/INFM (2003-2009). He held a -->
<!-- 	  postdoctoral position at the Darmstadt University of Technology -->
<!-- 	  (1998-2000) and an International Fellowship at the Queen's University -->
<!-- 	  of Belfast (2008). He participated to many collaborative European and -->
<!-- 	  Italian projects, also as principal investigator or local coordinator -->
<!-- 	  since 2005.</p> -->
<!-- 	<p> A.M. is the author or coauthor of about 70 publications on -->
<!-- 	  peer reviewed journals (with a H-index of 24 to date) including a -->
<!-- 	  Review of Modern Physics and 11 Physical Review Letters, the single -->
<!-- 	  author of a textbook on Laser-Plasma Interactions (Springer, 2013) and -->
<!-- 	  the first author of a textbook with 100 problems of Classical -->
<!-- 	  Electromagnetism (in Italian). He presented tens of seminars and talks -->
<!-- 	  (both invited and contributed) to international conferences and -->
<!-- 	  schools. He has been serving as a referee for about 30 international -->
<!-- 	  journals (with recognition as outstanding referee for the American -->
<!-- 	  Physical Society in 2015) and for 6 funding and evaluation agencies of -->
<!-- 	  different countries.</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>A.M. collaborates since 2002 to teaching activities at the -->
<!-- 	  Physics Department of the University of Pisa for the undergraduate -->
<!-- 	  (B.Sc.), postgraduate (M.Sc.) and doctorate (Ph.D.)  programs. He -->
<!-- 	  gives lecture courses of Plasma Physics since 2009 and is Lecturer of -->
<!-- 	  Classical Electrodynamics since 2012. He has been the supervisor of 2 -->
<!-- 	  Ph.D., 11 postgraduate (M.Sc.) and 17 undergraduate (B.Sc.) students -->
<!-- 	  to date, with 3 more Ph.D. (co-)supervisions running.</p> -->
