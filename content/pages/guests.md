<!-- 	  from the University of Pisa in 1995 with honors (110/110 cum laude) -->
<!-- 	  and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore of -->
<!-- 	  Pisa in 1999 with honors (70/70 cum laude).</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>Andrea Macchi has been active in laser-matter interaction at very -->
<!-- high intensities, beginning as an experimentalist (mostly working on -->
<!-- 	  X-ray emission from laser-produced plasmas) and later focusing on -->
<!-- 	  theory and simulation, still in close contact with experimental -->
<!-- 	  work. He has given contributions on topics such as collisionless -->
<!-- 	  absorption, surface wave excitation, ion acceleration, nonlinear -->
<!-- 	  coherent structures. </p> -->
<!-- 	<p>A.M. is a staff research scientist with CNR/INO since -->
<!-- 	  2010. Previously he was with CNR/INFM (2003-2009). He held a -->
<!-- 	  postdoctoral position at the Darmstadt University of Technology -->
<!-- 	  (1998-2000) and an International Fellowship at the Queen's University -->
<!-- 	  of Belfast (2008). He participated to many collaborative European and -->
<!-- 	  Italian projects, also as principal investigator or local coordinator -->
<!-- 	  since 2005.</p> -->
<!-- 	<p> A.M. is the author or coauthor of about 70 publications on -->
<!-- 	  peer reviewed journals (with a H-index of 24 to date) including a -->
<!-- 	  Review of Modern Physics and 11 Physical Review Letters, the single -->
<!-- 	  author of a textbook on Laser-Plasma Interactions (Springer, 2013) and -->
<!-- 	  the first author of a textbook with 100 problems of Classical -->
<!-- 	  Electromagnetism (in Italian). He presented tens of seminars and talks -->
<!-- 	  (both invited and contributed) to international conferences and -->
<!-- 	  schools. He has been serving as a referee for about 30 international -->
<!-- 	  journals (with recognition as outstanding referee for the American -->
<!-- 	  Physical Society in 2015) and for 6 funding and evaluation agencies of -->
<!-- 	  different countries.</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>A.M. collaborates since 2002 to teaching activities at the -->
<!-- 	  Physics Department of the University of Pisa for the undergraduate -->
<!-- 	  (B.Sc.), postgraduate (M.Sc.) and doctorate (Ph.D.)  programs. He -->
<!-- 	  gives lecture courses of Plasma Physics since 2009 and is Lecturer of -->
<!-- 	  Classical Electrodynamics since 2012. He has been the supervisor of 2 -->
<!-- 	  Ph.D., 11 postgraduate (M.Sc.) and 17 undergraduate (B.Sc.) students -->
<!-- 	  to date, with 3 more Ph.D. (co-)supervisions running.</p> -->
