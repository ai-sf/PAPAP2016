<p>A set of student talks and posters will be held at the GSSI and students of all levels and specialisations are invited to apply to present their research work, whether this is part of a thesis project (at bachelor, master or PhD level) or is an outcome of a summer research programme. A number of prizes will be awarded by the LNGS (see the <a class="indigo-text" href="files/APAP_Programme.pdf">Programme</a> for details).</p>

<p>To submit an abstract, both for a talk or a poster, use this templates:
