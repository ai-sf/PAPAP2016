	<p>Giancarlo Cella is a physicist, researcher at the INFN
sez. Pisa. He started his career working on perturbative QCD and
lattice gauge theory. He is currently involved in the VIRGO
collaboration, an experiment aiming to the direct observation of
gravitational waves. He is interested mainly in phenomenology and
detection of stochastic background of gravitational waves,
gravitational wave data analysis and advanced detectors.</p>

	<p>Massimo Inguscio graduated in physics from the University
	  of Pisa in 1972 and received his PhD from the Scuola Normale
	  Superiore of Pisa in 1976. </p>
	<p>A full Professor of Optics, Atomic Physics and Structure of
Matter at the University of Naples (from 1986) and at the University
of Florence (from 1991), he is co-founder of LENS, the European
Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy, which he led as Director for 6
years (1998-2004).  He was also Director of the Department for
Material and Devices (2009-2012) and of the Department for Sciences
and Technologies of Matter (2012-2014) of the CNR, the Italian
National Research Council.</p>
	  <p>In 2014 Massimo Inguscio has been appointed President of
the Italian National Institute for Metrological Research (INRIM). He
is Fellow of the Accademia dei Lincei, the American Physical Society
and the European Optical Society.  For the European Research Council
(ERC) he was Chairman (2007-2010) and Member (2012 and 2014) of the
Scientific Panel PE2 “Fundamental Constituents of Matter”. He received
prizes, such as the Humboldt Research Award by the Humboldt Foundation
(2004), the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences (2005) and
the “Herbert Walther” Award (2014) of the Deutsche Physikalische
Gesellschaft and of the Optical Society.</p>

	<p>Andrea Macchi received a M.Sc. degree (Laurea) in Physics
	  from the University of Pisa in 1995 with honors (110/110 cum laude)
	  and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from the Scuola Normale Superiore of
	  Pisa in 1999 with honors (70/70 cum laude).</p>
	<p>Andrea Macchi has been active in laser-matter interaction at very
high intensities, beginning as an experimentalist (mostly working on
	  X-ray emission from laser-produced plasmas) and later focusing on
	  theory and simulation, still in close contact with experimental
	  work. He has given contributions on topics such as collisionless
	  absorption, surface wave excitation, ion acceleration, nonlinear
	  coherent structures. </p>
	<p>A.M. is a staff research scientist with CNR/INO since
	  2010. Previously he was with CNR/INFM (2003-2009). He held a
	  postdoctoral position at the Darmstadt University of Technology
	  (1998-2000) and an International Fellowship at the Queen's University
	  of Belfast (2008). He participated to many collaborative European and
	  Italian projects, also as principal investigator or local coordinator
	  since 2005.</p>
	<p> A.M. is the author or coauthor of about 70 publications on
	  peer reviewed journals (with a H-index of 24 to date) including a
	  Review of Modern Physics and 11 Physical Review Letters, the single
	  author of a textbook on Laser-Plasma Interactions (Springer, 2013) and
	  the first author of a textbook with 100 problems of Classical
	  Electromagnetism (in Italian). He presented tens of seminars and talks
	  (both invited and contributed) to international conferences and
	  schools. He has been serving as a referee for about 30 international
	  journals (with recognition as outstanding referee for the American
	  Physical Society in 2015) and for 6 funding and evaluation agencies of
	  different countries.</p>
	<p>A.M. collaborates since 2002 to teaching activities at the
	  Physics Department of the University of Pisa for the undergraduate
	  (B.Sc.), postgraduate (M.Sc.) and doctorate (Ph.D.)  programs. He
	  gives lecture courses of Plasma Physics since 2009 and is Lecturer of
	  Classical Electrodynamics since 2012. He has been the supervisor of 2
	  Ph.D., 11 postgraduate (M.Sc.) and 17 undergraduate (B.Sc.) students
	  to date, with 3 more Ph.D. (co-)supervisions running.</p>
